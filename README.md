## Description
This is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that allows the user to create notes or code snippets with or without internet connections, further allows for the app to be installed.

The app has been bundled using webpack and the data is stored using the idb package.

The simplicity of the app makes it very functional, although for future development, being able to put side notes may be beneficial.
